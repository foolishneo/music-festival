# Music festival data

On the server, festival service calls the API to get data and transformed it by the [mapping function](https://github.com/foolishneo/music-festival/blob/master/server/src/festivals/mapping/festival-bands.mapping.ts). 

Angular controller uses service to call the server's API to get data and display it in the template.

### Things to be improved
- Write unit tests
- Use swagger to generate code
- Authentication
